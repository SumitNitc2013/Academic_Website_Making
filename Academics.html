Information Technology has revolutionized not only the data processing and storage, 
but also the quality of life, communication, manufacturing and transportation. PC, 
Laptop and Internet have become a household commodity. 

Our computer engineering department has state-of-the-art laboratories in the various fields 
of computer engineering-processor development  testing lab, signal processing lab, LIC lab, 
software lab, networking lab, web-designing lab, multi-media lab, CAD-CAM lab, software engineering 
lab etc. 

The curriculum in computer engineering lay greater importance on design and development, in addition 
to software packages. Industrial training is an essential part of the curriculum. Miniaturization in 
computer technology, audio-video and image processing, storage and retrieval, data processing, 
communication and nano-technology etc are going to influence the computer knowledge in the coming 
decades. 

Recent advancements in the areas of computers, software, networking, internet, communication technology, 
distributed computing has made vast amount of information available to us. In this high-tech age, information 
is something without which industry and individuals cannot endure, and their success depends on the aptitude 
to acquire perfect and timely information. In the recent years, the world has seen the area of Information 
Technology speedily growing. Keeping this in mind, UIT has a B. TECH. level program in Information Technology. 

As the demand for a rapid transmission of information over global networks is growing at an exponential rate, 
the impact of optical communication is progressively more felt in virtually all aspects of communication 
technology. 

B. TECH. in Information Technology curriculum is mainly focused on computer science, software development, 
networking, communication, web engineering, security, hardware design and management. Specific knowledge on 
the scrutiny and design of information systems is imparted. Further, industrial training and various electives
 related to emerging IT areas form an imperative component of Information Technology curriculum, so that the 
 students are able to meet the challenges faced by todayâ€™s industries. 

The course for IT is tailor-made to fit the needs of the field of IT with a great emphasis on the 
decision-making
 facets of software development in order to create not just engineers who are part-time managers, 
 but manager-engineers. The course includes ample management subjects to meet the above goals. 
 It favors web-centric technologies and information management along with usual areas and related 
 projects.
