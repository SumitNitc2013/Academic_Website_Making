		<pre>
		Engineering education must evolve to keep pace with great changes 
		occurring in business, industry, and society Engineers must develop 
		attributes and understanding ahead of conventional constraints of the 
		classroom. Engineering education must be deliberate to have room for 
		current trends and future needs. Engineering education must build more 
		connections and stronger affiliation with the global society in which 
		we are rooted. We must inspect the significance of curriculum and attempt
		 for realization of university, college, and professional missions. 

		Universal Institute of Technology is an upcoming premier institution approved 
		under AICTE, Govt. of India  affiliated to GJU ST. Our ambition is to articulate 
		the role of engineering education and to set up design specifications that will 
		facilitate us to be a leader in determining the prospect of engineering education. 
		As such we have a commitment to address the full array of higher education, that is:
		 teaching and learning, research, and service to the community. Indeed, these three 
		 elements must be completely incorporated if we are to be successful in the pursuit 
		 of our mission. 

		Engineering and technology play a central role in manufacturing, including the
		 manufacturing or processing associated with agro-products. It should also be 
		 obvious that engineering proficiency and technology are major contributors to 
		 mining, construction, transportation and infrastructure. 

		Use of existing technologies and formation of new technologies are at the heart 
		of the engineering profession. Designing our educational program towards these 
		ends will have a remarkable impact on the practicability of the profession in practice. 

		UIT has determined its exclusivity in order to be an efficient representative of 
		change in engineering education for the 21st century. Our mission consists of three 
		parts, education, research, and services. Our dedication is verified by appropriate 
		concern for the intellectual and personal well being of our students. 

		We can offer our students a complete learning experience. And the industry and 
		government agencies that hire our students will receive the very best quality 
		graduates. Our contacts with industry and the collegeâ€™s connections with other 
		educational institutions in the country are evidence to the extent of our 
		institution.
